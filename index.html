    <h1> Peart's life</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Peart was born on September 12, 1952, in Ontario, Canada and is the first of four siblings.</li>
        <li>For his 14th birthday Peart received his first drumkit and began taking lessons and within the year he had his first stage debut.</li>
        <li>By his late teens Peart had played in several bands.</li>
        <li>At only 18 years of age, having difficulty achieving success in Canada, Peart travelled to London in hopes of furthering his career as a professional musician</li>
        <li>During this period Peart found the writings of Ayn Rand which became a significant influence on him.</li>
        <li>After 18 months in London, finding no progress in his music career, Peart returned to Canada</li>
        <li>In 1974, the band Rush needed a replacement for their original drummer, which Peart auditioned for. </li>
        <li>While Peart felt the audition was a disaster, he officially joined the band on July 29, 1974, two weeks before the group's first US tour.</li>
        <li>On August 14, 1974, they played in front of over 11,000 people at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</li>
        <li>The other band members, Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee, were not much interested in lyric writing so Peart became the primary lyricist.</li>
        <li><i>Fly by Night</i> was the first recording by the trio and was fairly successful, winning an award for most promising new act.</li>
        <li>The next album, <i> Caress of Steel</i> was not as successful. The response to this by Rush was to lean into what made them different and their next album, <i>2112</i>, was a breakout hit.</li>
        <li>The many albums to come afterwards and over 40 years of touring cemented their place as rock legends.</li>
        <li>While Peart's professional life was very successful and bright, he had some personal tragedies starting in 1997 with his first and (at the time) only daughter, 19, dying in a car accident and his common-law wife of 23 years succumbing to cancer just 10 months later.</li>
        <li>In his book <i>Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road</i>, Peart wrote that he told his bandmates at his daughter's funeral, "consider me retired." </li>
        <li>Peart took a long sabbatical to mourn and travelled extensively throughout North and Central America on his motorcycle, covering over 88,000km. After his journey, Peart decided to return to the band and his music career.</li>
        <li>In December 2015 Peart officially retired from music, having suffered from tendonitis and shoulder problems that affected his playing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="tribute">I made this tribute page about Peart because he inspired me to become a drummer in the first place which has given me a lifelong love for drumming and a deeper respect and love for music in general.</p>
